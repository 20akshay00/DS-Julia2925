md"""## 1. Trajecting trajectories

Suppose you find yourself on top of a snowy mountain, sparsely covered with trees. You want to reach the bottom of the mountain using your sled, but the situation you find yourself in is certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.

Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (this will serve as the input later) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:

```
..##.......
#...#...#..
.#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#.
..#.##.....
.#.#.#....#
.#........#
#.##...#...
#...##....#
.#..#...#.#
```

These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times ü§ØÔ∏è:

```
..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
.#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
#...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
```

You start on the open square `(.)` in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).

Your sled can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:

From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.

The locations you would check in the above example are marked here with `O` where there was an open square and `X` where there was a tree:

```
..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
#..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
.#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
.#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
.#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
#.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
#...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
```

In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.

Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.

Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

    Right 1, down 1.
    Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
    Right 5, down 1.
    Right 7, down 1.
    Right 1, down 2.

In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively; multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.

What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?""")

		The alternative solutions makes use of the fact that the boundaries are circular. As an example, this would be valid:
		```julia
		A = ['a', 'b', 'c']
		A[1] == A[4] == A[7]
		```
		So we need some datastructure that behaves like a normal array, but with wonky out-of-bounds behaviour!

		In julia, a custom datatype can be defined as:
		```
		struct CircularArray 
			data
		end
		```
		Now we have our data type `CircularArray`, which has a field `data`.
		Using our knowledge from the simple example above, let us define a function which takes an index and the length of the array and returns the correct index using circular bounds. We will also create a function that takes an array of indices and returns an array of correct indices. Take a moment to think about how you would do this, and afterwards check a possible implementation in hint 1.
		
		So now we know how the compute the **normal** indices from the circular ones. 
		We now need to define some things for our new datatype `CircularArray`. 
		1. We need the `size` of `CircularArray` and 
		2. we need to define how `A[1]` works on our datatype (this is the `getindex` function in julia).
		For the first problem, note that the size of a `CircularArray` is actually the size of the underlying array! So how do you think the function `Base.size(A::CircularArray) = ...` looks like? 
		For the second problem we need a definition of `Base.getindex(A::CircularArray, i::Int)`. How can we define this using the `circindex` function? 
		If you have given this some thought, check out hint no 2 for the answer!.

If we want to go down the slope using our sled in the configuration of 1 down + 3 right, we can write down the *mountain coordinates* like this:

```julia
(1, 1)
(2, 4)
(3, 7)
(4, 10)
(5, 13)
...
```
We have not talked about collections and ranges, yet so this will be a sneak peak. You can define a range in julia like this: `1:5`. This will give you the values `[1,2,3,4,5]`. On the other hand, `1:2:5` will give you `[1,3,5]`. Do you see the difference? 
change some values in the two cells below to check if you understand the basics on this concept. Then, think about how you would write up the list of x-coordinates and y-coordinates if you go down the slope 1 down, 3 right.
