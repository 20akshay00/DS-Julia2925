## 1. Abstract

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge featuring daily puzzles to celebrate Christmas. Each day presents a problem that Santa must solve using his programming skills. Participants parse a unique puzzle input, compute the requested result (usually a number), and submit their solutions. Each puzzle consists of two parts, earning one star each. In this project, you'll complete one day of your choice to earn both stars, providing an excellent opportunity to enhance your programming skills.

## 2. Background

Advent of Code puzzles aims to sharpen your skills in basic programming techniques, including regular expressions, and data structures such as trees or hash maps. The early days are suitable for novice programmers, while the later ones can challenge even experienced engineers at companies like Google.
