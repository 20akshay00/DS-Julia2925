# Advanced mechanistic modelling with ModellingToolkit.jl

**tags:** *modelling, differential equations, physics, computer algebra systems*

## 1. Abstract

ModellingToolkit.jl (MTK) is a powerful acausial modelling software, that can automatically derive the model equations based on its performant computer algebra system. This project invites you to develop your own (physical) system based on ODE's together with the visualizations.

## 2. Background

In the tutorials we show how to model and simulate three fairly standard systems with MTK:
- a conical tank with in- and outflow;
- a damped spring model;
- the Lotka-Volterra equations.

The advanced tutorial demonstrates how to use Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations of motion and simulate a (double) pendulum.

## 3. Assignments

Pick a (physical) system of your choice, derive the ODE system, simulate it and make a visualization.
