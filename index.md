# Julia2925: learn a fast and intuitive programming language in two workdays

## Introduction
The [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) has taken the scientific computing community by storm. In Julia, the user can write high-level code that is easy to write but also blazingly fast. Its type-based dispatch system allows creating versatile code in a few lines of elegant code. It has gained enormous popularity in numerical computing, statistics, machine learning, etc.

This two-day course gives an in-depth introduction to the Julia programming language. The first day will introduce Julia programming's essential elements (variables, printing, plotting, looping, collections, etc.) and an early peek into the type system. On the second day, we will cover the type system comprehensively. We discuss its relation to multiple dispatch and illustrate how this translates into extensible and user-friendly programs. We cover the subject matter interactively in interactive notebooks. Each day, we make a larger synthesis project in the afternoon.

## Who is this for?
We mainly cater to PhD students in sciences and engineering, especially those who have a computing aspect in their research (large or small). The course is relevant to researchers who need to write complex high-level code that has to be performant. Importantly, this course is *not* meant as a first introduction to programming. Participants are expected to have basic experience in at least one high-level programming language such as Python, R, Matlab, or Perl. We aim to start gentle enough so that novice programmers can get acquainted with the language while following a learning curve that will keep serious hackers interested. At the end of the course, you will have to tools to write fairly sophisticated Julia programs.

## Date and venue
The course will take place on **4 and 5 February 2020** (during the inter-term recess). If the course is allowed on-site, it will take place in a PC-room at Campus Coupure. If we cannot meet on-site, the course will be taught online with maximal interactivity.

## Registration and fees
Registration can be via the following link: ADD LINK.

Admission prices are:
- **for UGent doctoral school members**: EUR 50 (paid by the DS);
- **external members**: EUR 250.

We also provide a limited number of free slots for master students. Please contact the organizers if you want to join.

## Organizer information
This course is organized by [Michiel Stock](https://github.com/MichielStock/), [Daan Van Hauwermeiren](https://github.com/DaanVanHauwermeiren), and [Bram De Jaegher](https://github.com/Beramos), three researchers of the Department of Mathematical Modelling and Data Analysis of the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering. They have ample experience using Julia for both research and education.
